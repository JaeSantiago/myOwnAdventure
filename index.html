        <h3>Jay Critch is 20 years old, he was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY and is now rising in fame, so you know that he is living that "fast life." He will be deciding whether he wants to go on a worldwide tour or if he's going to just perform in certain States of the U.S. Not too many people know about Jay Critch yet but I can guarantee that his music will arise and be seen.</h3>
